# Markdown Forge API Documentation

This directory contains the generated API documentation for Markdown Forge's backend services.

## Overview

The API documentation is automatically generated from the FastAPI endpoints and provides comprehensive information about:

- Available endpoints
- Request parameters
- Response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error responses

## Accessing Documentation

There are two ways to access the API documentation:

1. **Swagger UI**: Interactive documentation that allows you to try out API endpoints directly in the browser.
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/docs when the backend is running

2. **ReDoc**: Clean, responsive documentation with a focus on readability.
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/redoc when the backend is running

## API Structure

The API follows REST principles and is organized into the following sections:

### File Operations
- Upload files
- List files
- Get file details
- Delete files
- Rename files

### Conversion Operations
- Convert files
- Batch convert files
- Get conversion status
- Get conversion history
- Download converted files

### Template Management
- Create templates
- List templates
- Get template details
- Update templates
- Delete templates

### System Operations
- Health check
- System status
- Configuration
- Metrics

## Authentication

All endpoints are protected with JWT authentication. To access the API, you need to:

1. Obtain a JWT token by authenticating with the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint
2. Include the token in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

## Error Handling

The API uses a standardized error response format:

```json
{
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": "Additional error details (optional)"
}
```

## API Versioning

The API is versioned with a prefix in the URL: `/api/v1/`. This ensures backward compatibility as the API evolves.

## Generation

This documentation is automatically generated by the API docs utility in the backend:

```python
# backend/utils/api_docs.py
```

## Development

When developing new API endpoints, follow these guidelines:

1. Use descriptive endpoint names that follow REST conventions
2. Document parameters and responses using FastAPI's docstring annotations
3. Include examples for request and response bodies
4. Document error responses
5. Test endpoints using the Swagger UI

After making changes to the API, update this documentation by running:

```bash
python -m backend.utils.api_docs
```
