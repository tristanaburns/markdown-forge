## Actions for AI Assistant

# Pre-requisite
Before starting any development work, thoroughly review the current entire chat history and previous chat histories to ensure you understand the context and the progress of the project. This step is mandatory to maintain consistency and avoid duplication of effort. Then, review the following files:
- `@project-requirements.md`
-  `@project-plan.md`
- `@README.md`
- `@/app/README.md`
- `@/backend/README.md`


1. Continue executing the tasks and instructions in the `@project-plan.md` file, following the defined phases and implementation steps.

2. Implement the project according to the requirements and specifications in `@project-requirements.md`, ensuring all functionality is properly developed.

3. Before creating any new files, functions, or code:
   - Thoroughly review the existing project directory structure
   - Check for similar or duplicate implementations
   - Reference existing code patterns and conventions

4. If duplicate functions, files, code, or content are found:
   - Consolidate the duplicates into a single, well-structured implementation
   - Refine the code to ensure it follows best practices
   - Update all references to use the consolidated implementation

5. Maintain accurate progress tracking in `@project-plan.md`:
   - Update task statuses (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
   - Add completion dates for finished tasks
   - Include detailed notes about implementation decisions

6. Enhance `@project-plan.md` with any additional steps or tasks that were not originally covered but are necessary for project completion.

7. Follow the established coding standards and patterns visible in the existing codebase, particularly regarding:
   - Error handling with the centralized error handler
   - Proper logging using the application logger
   - Documentation standards with docstrings and comments
   - Type annotations and validation

8. Create and update the README.md documents as you complete tasks and while reviewing the files in the project, ensuring:
   - Comprehensive documentation of all implemented features and functionality
   - Clear installation and setup instructions with prerequisites
   - Detailed usage examples with code snippets and screenshots
   - Explanation of configuration options and environment variables
   - Troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - API documentation if applicable
   - Contribution guidelines and development setup instructions
   - License information and acknowledgments


9. Update all the README.md files in all the directories to ensure that they are upto date and the file structure is correct,

10. Update the `@project-plan.md` and `@project-requirements.md` to ensure they are up to date and align with the readme.md files and the file structure is correct.
